# LatInt: a Python package representing a collection of functions to aid 
The goal of this package is to facilitate the interpretation and quality control of low-dimensional latent spaces generated by dimensionality reduction methods, using heterogeneous input feature types (e.g. numerical as well as image-based inputs). 


## In development:
This package was the results of the collective efforts of our lab prompted by the immediate need for some of these functions, and as such are extremely tailored to our workflows. It's actively under development and extra modules, generalization and documentation are all still underway.

##

## Usage:
- Install package
```bash
pip install latint
```

- Load your latent space
```python


```

## Dependancies:
- numpy
- pandas
- tqdm
- matplotlib
- torch
- scanpy
- anndata==0.8 
*We take a specific version of anndata because some mismatch between anndata and scanpy exists.*
