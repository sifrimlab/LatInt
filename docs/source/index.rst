Welcome to LatInt's documentation!
===================================

**LatInt**  The goal of this package is to facilitate the interpretation and quality control of low-dimensional latent spaces generated by dimensionality reduction methods, using heterogeneous input feature types (e.g. Numerical as well as image-based inputs).

It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
